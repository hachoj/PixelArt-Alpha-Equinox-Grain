## Pixart-$\alpha$ From Scratch

I originally did this entire project with JAX/Equinox/Grain, that repo can be found here: https://github.com/hachoj/PixelArt-Alpha-Equinox-Grain. I chose to switch to a PyTorch focus again mostly due to adoption. 

I quite enjoyed the porcess of using JAX and Equinox especially and in my perfect world that's what I would keep doing. However, for practical reasons, I'm closing myself off from oportunities by specializing so early in my career. I will keep up with JAX so I can switch back if a oportunity needs it gladly.
